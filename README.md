# Hashing-Algorithm
Hashing algorithm in C
This is a hashing algorithm that I have written in C. It reads a text file of names, runs the hashing algorithm and places each name into the hash table, ready to be
searched for or removed. The code also allows you to add your own strings into the hash table.
